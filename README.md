# Tableau Dashboard on London Bike Rides

Project Description: Exploring London Bike Sharing Data with Python and Tableau

Introduction:
The project aims to uncover insights from the London Bike Sharing Dataset, available on Kaggle. This fascinating dataset contains a wealth of information about bike-sharing patterns in London, offering valuable insights into how weather conditions affect bike ride usage. To achieve this goal, we will use Python to directly connect to the Kaggle dataset, extract relevant metadata, and convert it into user-friendly descriptions. Furthermore, we will leverage Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between bike rides and weather changes. The project's focus on heatmaps and moving average graphs will allow for a deeper understanding of the dataset.

1. Data Connection and Metadata Description:
   - **Python**: In the initial phase of the project, Python will serve as the main tool to connect to the Kaggle dataset. Using libraries such as Pandas, we will fetch and load the data for further analysis. Metadata about various aspects of the dataset, such as column names, data types, and descriptions, will be extracted and converted into user-friendly text. This step is crucial for understanding the dataset and facilitating the subsequent visualization process.

2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
   - With the dataset loaded, we will perform data exploration and preprocessing in Python. This includes handling missing values, data type conversions, and data cleaning to ensure that the dataset is in optimal condition for analysis.

3. Tableau Dashboard Creation:
   - **Tableau**: Tableau will be our primary tool for creating an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. We will import the cleaned dataset into Tableau, enabling us to explore the data through intuitive and interactive visualizations. The key elements of the Tableau dashboard will include:
     - **Heatmaps**: Heatmaps will be used to showcase the spatial distribution of bike ride usage throughout London. By layering weather data on top of these heatmaps, we can visually assess how weather conditions impact bike ride patterns. This will provide valuable insights into areas where weather has a substantial effect on bike ride usage.
     - **Moving Average Graphs**: To gain a deeper understanding of trends over time, moving average graphs will be utilized. These graphs will help us identify long-term patterns and correlations between weather changes and bike ride trends. By smoothing out the data, we can highlight underlying trends and seasonality that may not be evident in the raw data.

4. Interactive Features:
   - The Tableau dashboard will include interactive features, such as filters and tooltips. Users can customize their views by selecting specific time frames, weather conditions, and geographic areas, providing a dynamic exploration experience. Tooltips will provide additional information and insights when hovering over data points.

5. Data Insights:
   - The primary objective of this project is to draw meaningful insights from the London Bike Sharing Dataset. By visualizing the data with heatmaps and moving average graphs, we can identify patterns and correlations between weather changes and bike ride usage. This information can be valuable for city planners, bike-sharing service providers, and even individual riders. For example, we may discover that certain weather conditions lead to increased bike ride demand, allowing businesses to optimize their services accordingly.

6. Conclusion and Future Work:
   - In conclusion, this project leverages Python and Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that explores the relationship between weather conditions and bike ride usage in London. The heatmaps and moving average graphs provide a comprehensive overview of the data, offering insights that can inform future decisions related to bike-sharing services and urban planning. As a future extension of this project, one could explore predictive modeling to forecast bike ride demand based on weather forecasts, further enhancing the practical applications of this analysis.

By combining data extraction and description with Tableau's visualization capabilities, this project promises to offer a deeper understanding of how weather changes influence bike-sharing behavior in London, with potential implications for urban mobility and transportation planning.
